# Matter Binding

The Matter Binding for openHAB allows seamless integration with Matter-compatible devices.

# Matter Ecosystem Overview

Matter is an open-source connectivity standard for smart home devices, allowing seamless communication between a wide range of devices, controllers, and ecosystems. The following section is an overview of how Matter devices work, how they get an IPv6 address, and the commissioning process for pairing devices.

## Matter Devices

### Nodes and Endpoints

In the Matter ecosystem, a **node** represents a single device that joins a Matter network. A **node** can have multiple **endpoints**, which are logical representations of specific features or functionalities of the device. For example, a smart thermostat (node) may have an endpoint for temperature control and another for fan speed.

**Example:**
- A smart light bulb (node) with multiple color and brightness controls (endpoints).

### Controllers

A **controller** manages the interaction between Matter devices and other parts of the network. Controllers can send commands, receive updates, and facilitate device communication. They also handle the commissioning process when new devices are added to the network.

**Example:**
- openHAB, another smart home hub or a smartphone app that manages your smart light bulbs, door locks, and sensors.

### Bridges

A **bridge** is a special type of node that connects non-Matter devices to a Matter network, effectively translating between protocols. Bridges allow legacy devices to be controlled via the Matter standard.

**Example:**
- A bridge that connects Zigbee or Z-Wave devices, making them accessible within a Matter ecosystem. Ikea and Hue bridges both now support matter.

### Thread Border Routers

A **Thread Border Router** is a device that allows devices connected via Thread (a low-power wireless protocol) to communicate with devices on other networks, such as Wi-Fi or Ethernet. It facilitates IPv6-based communication between Thread networks and the local IP network.

**Example:**
- An Open Thread Boarder Router (open source) as well as recent versions of Apple TVs, Amazon Echos and Google Nest Hubs all have embedded thread boarder routers. 

## IPv6 and Network Connectivity

Matter devices operate over an IPv6 network, and obtaining an IPv6 address is essential for communication. Devices can connect to the network via different interfaces:

### Ethernet
Ethernet-connected Matter devices receive an IPv6 address through standard DHCPv6 or stateless address auto-configuration (SLAAC).

### Wi-Fi
Wi-Fi-enabled Matter devices also receive an IPv6 address using DHCPv6 or SLAAC. They rely on the existing Wi-Fi infrastructure for communication within the Matter ecosystem.

### Thread
Thread-based Matter devices connect to the network via a **Thread Border Router**. They receive an IPv6 address from the Thread router

## IPv6 Requirements

For Matter devices to function correctly, **IPv6** must be enabled and supported in both the local network (router) and the Matter controllers. Without IPv6, devices wonâ€™t be able to communicate properly within the Matter ecosystem. Ensure that your router has IPv6 enabled and that any Matter controllers (like smart hubs, apps or openHAB) are configured to support IPv6 as well.

**Note that environments like Docker require special configurations to enable IPv6**

## Matter Commissioning and Pairing Codes

Commissioning a Matter device involves securely adding it to the network using a **pairing code**. This process ensures that only authorized devices can join the network.

### Pairing Code from the Device
When commissioning a new Matter device, it typically has a printed QR code or numeric pairing code that you scan or enter during setup. This pairing code allows the controller to establish a secure connection to the device and add it to the network. Once a device pairing code is in use, it can not be used again to pair other controllers.

### Additional Pairing Code from a Controller
If a device has already been commissioned and you need to add it to another controller, the existing controller can generate an additional pairing code. This is useful when sharing access to a device across multiple hubs or apps. Apple Home, Google Home, Amazon Alexa and openHAB all support generating pairing codes for existing paired devices. 

### Example:
- When setting up a smart lock, you may scan a QR code directly from the lock, or use the 11 digit pairing code printed on it to pair it with openHAB. If you later want to control the lock from another app or hub, you would retrieve a new pairing code directly from openHAB.

# Matter Binding Configuration

## Supported Things

The Matter Binding supports the following types of things:

- `controller`: The main controller that interfaces with Matter devices. It requires configuration parameters such as `port`, `host`, `portId`, and `pairCode`.
- `endpoint`: Represents an individual endpoint within the Matter network. Configuration parameters include `nodeId` and `endpointId`.

## Discovery

Matter controllers must be added manually.  Endpoint (devices) will be discovered when a `pairCode` is used to search for a device to add. 

## Binding Configuration

This binding does not require any general configuration settings.

## Thing Configuration

### Controller Thing Configuration

The controller thing must be created manually before devices can be discovered.

Note: pairCode configuration field is only available in 4.3 milestone builds or later and only usable through the Main UI or API 

### Endpoint Thing Configuration

Endpoints are discovered automatically.  Once a controller is active, enter the device's 11 digit pairing code, either from the manufacturer if this device has not been commissioned yet, or from another matter controller into the controller's configuration in the MainUI.  Once save is clicked, the device will show up in the user's inbox if found.
